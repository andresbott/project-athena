This is not a full fledged step by step instruction, but a bunch of notes that I took while mounting the PC.

If you decide to follow my steps, please contact me and we can improve this part.

## Mounting

1. Mount the 3x 12cm front fans, they need to be fixed from the inside with screws![Fans](/home/odo/datos/edit/projects/project-athena/imgs/Fans.jpg)

2. Mount the on/off Button on top of the 3d printed part and then screw that in to the front. ![On_Off_Button](/home/odo/datos/edit/projects/project-athena/imgs/On_Off_Button.jpg)

3. Mount the HHD enclosuers, using screws from the front side, using the 14cm rails, note that the bottom HDD enclosure i drilled a 4mm hole from the back surface (where the motherboard is screwed) and then fixed that there.

4. Mount the bottom side SSD holder, this is only the one piece that will be used later to fix the enclousre

5. Use the SSD hole template to drill 2x 4mm on the PSU shroud, used to fix the SSDs from the other side.

6. Now using 6x the small 3d printed spacers, screw in the front panel; I used regular m3 nuts.![TheFront_02_Screws](/home/odo/datos/edit/projects/project-athena/imgs/TheFront_02_Screws.jpg)

   

7. Pc mounting time: now You can put in the PSU, the SSDs in the bottom, cables

   1. To mount the motherboard you will need to remove the 14cm extratc fan, otherwise probably it will note fit; Note that in my case it was quite tight to get the motherboard but it did fit in the end. ![InsideNoDisks](/home/odo/datos/edit/projects/project-athena/imgs/InsideNoDisks.jpg)
